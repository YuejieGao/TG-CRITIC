Partial data of paper submitted to ICASSP2023: TG-CRITIC: A TIMBRE-GUIDED MODEL FOR REFERENCE-INDEPENDENT SINGING EVALUATION

This consists of the following (all used for the paper above):

## Label Description
- The three levels of labeling in our dataset are determined by two dimensions: 
- - Awesome(A) - Use label 0 to indicate. Works with excellent intonation or only a few notes with slight deviation, and no obvious flaws in the singing technique; 
- - Mediocre(M) - Use label 1 to indicate. Works with excellent intonation or only a few notes with slight deviation, but some flaws in singing technique; 
- - Inferior(I) - Use label 2 to indicate. Works with many out-of-tune notes, and nonnegligible flaws in singing technique.
